The algorithm and engineering models were coded in Matlab/Simulink, leveraging Simscape Power Systems, SimEvents, and LTE System Toolbox. The algorithm outperformed the LTE standard algorithm, demonstrating 20%-40% absolute reductions in packet drop rate and 10-20 ms reductions in latency for all smart grid applications modeled. The results of this project has been published in a peer reviewed IEEE journal. DOI: 10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2920662.",

      "description": "This project automates the monitoring of a Linux server cluster's activity. Machine usage data and hardware information gets stored in a PostgreSQL database, which is automatically populated by a network of server nodes every minute. The intended use case of this software is to help Linux Cluster Administration teams evaluate their server cluster's activity and compare it with their physical assets to inform their future assets planning decisions (e.g. adding/removing servers).\nThe database host setup has been automated with shell scripts, and a .sql file has also been written that contains common queries used by system administrators. Moreover, we automatically configure the installation of PostgreSQL with a shell script that creates a Docker container containing PostgreSQL complete with a persistent Docker volume that stores the data managed by the PostgreSQL instance running in the container.",

Our Dockerized Java program accepts a Twitter Developer's OAuth 1.0 credentials needed to be serviced by the Twitter REST API, in addition to the information about the post/show/delete Tweet action to be performed as command line inputs. The application then proceeds to contact the Twitter API to fulfill the request, and prints the JSON file(s) containing information about the Tweets that the user just posted/read/deleted.",
        "JDBC App: This application sets up a connection via the JDBC API to a PostGreSQL database that manages a business' customer and order records. The core concept of this project was to develop objects that can streamline the process of building Strings that contain SQL statements which can be fed to JDBC APIs, whereupon the PostGreSQL driver that implements the JDBC interfaces can forward the SQL statements to the database application, and receive its response.",
        "Grep App: This application recreates partial functionality of the grep command commonly used in the Linux command line. More specifically, given an input regular expression, directory, and output path/filename, it will search through all files found in the directory and all its sub directories for instances of the regular expression, and print the lines of text containing these instances into the indicated file. This app leverages Java streams to remain functional when its heap memory is smaller than the files it is reading."

  "summary": "I recently completed my graduate studies at the University of Ottawa, obtaining a Masters of Applied Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I qualified for $76,000 in scholarships and NSERC CREATE stipends during my two years at the University of Ottawa, including the nationally recognized NSERC CGS-M scholarship. My thesis topic was on improving the performance of device-to-device mobile communications via reinforcement learning algorithms to make them suitable for smart grid applications. My work has resulted in five publications, two of which being journals of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE Access and IEEE Systems Journal).\n\n I also have some industry data science experience, having developed electricity price forecasting neural networks with BluWave~AI, and a reinforcement learning based electric vehicle charging controller for the world renowned Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems in Freiburg, Germany. \n\n\nThe work I enjoy most is solving problems with computers while applying principles of discrete mathematics. As such, I am currently seeking rich opportunities to expand my skills in software development to a professional level; my time with Jarvis has significantly improved my programming skills, and I am eager to share them with the world."

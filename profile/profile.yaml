summary: "I recently completed my graduate studies at the University of Ottawa, obtaining a Masters of Applied Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I qualified for $76,000 in scholarships and NSERC CREATE stipends during my two years at the University of Ottawa, including the nationally recognized NSERC CGS-M scholarship. My thesis topic was on improving the performance of device-to-device mobile communications via reinforcement learning algorithms to make them suitable for smart grid applications. My work has resulted in five publications, including two publications in journals created by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE Access and IEEE Systems Journal).\n\n I also have some industry data science experience, having developed electricity price forecasting neural networks with BluWave~AI, and a reinforcement learning-based electric vehicle charging controller for the world-renowned Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems in Freiburg, Germany. \n\n

The work I enjoy most is solving problems with computers while applying the principles of discrete mathematics. As such, I am currently seeking rich opportunities to expand my skills in software development to a professional level; my time with Jarvis has significantly improved my programming skills, and I am eager to share them with the world."

    description: "This project automates the monitoring of a Linux server cluster's activity. Machine usage data and hardware information gets stored in a PostgreSQL database, which is automatically populated by a network of server nodes every minute. The intended use case of this software is to help Linux Cluster Administration teams evaluate their server cluster's activity and compare it with their physical assets to inform their future assets planning decisions (e.g. adding/removing servers).

The database host setup has been automated with shell scripts, and a .sql file has also been written that contains common queries used by system administrators. Moreover, we automatically configure the installation of PostgreSQL with a shell script that creates a Docker container containing PostgreSQL complete with a persistent Docker volume that stores the data managed by the PostgreSQL instance running in the container."
  - name: "Core Java Apps"
    git_url: "/core_java"
    description:
      - "Twitter API App: This application allows a user to post, read, and delete Tweets from the Linux Command Line Interface. Our Dockerized Java program accepts a Twitter Developer's OAuth 1.0 credentials needed to be serviced by the Twitter REST API, in addition to the information about the post/show/delete Tweet action to be performed as command line inputs. The application then proceeds to contact the Twitter API to fulfill the request, and prints the JSON file(s) containing information about the Tweets that the user just posted/read/deleted. Apache Maven was used in this project for organizing its build workflow; part of this workflow includes unit/integration test phases, where Maven commands can execute rigorous software test scripts written with the JUnit test framework."
      - "JDBC App: This application sets up a connection via the JDBC API to a PostgreSQL database that manages a business' customer and order records. The core concept of this project was to develop objects that can streamline the process of building Strings that contain SQL statements which can be fed to JDBC APIs, whereupon the PostgreSQL driver that implements the JDBC interfaces can forward the SQL statements to the database application, and receive its response."
      - "Grep App: This application recreates partial functionality of the grep command commonly used in the Linux command line. More specifically, given an input regular expression, directory, and output path/filename, it will search through all files found in the directory and all its sub-directories for instances of the regular expression, and print the lines of text containing these instances into the indicated file. This app leverages Java streams to remain functional when its heap memory is smaller than the files it is reading."
  - name: "SpringBoot Microservice Stock Trading App (REST API)"
    git_url: "/springboot"
    description: "This project created a stock trading service in the form of a SpringBoot REST API application, where users could interact with a webserver to create an online account that they could deposit funds within, and then proceed to build and manage a securities portfolio. We provide up to date stock information from the online IEX stock exchange for our users to keep their investment strategies well informed.  This web application uses SpringBoot to automatically configure Apache Tomcat, a Java web applet that can forward client requests to the components of our code that can handle them while converting the requests into a format our code can understand. SpringBoot was also used to facilitate constructing our application's interdependent objects and utilizing JDBC drivers to access our local database."
  - name: "Python Data Analytics"
    git_url: "/python_data_wrangling"
    description: "This project analyzed an e-commerce store's customer transaction data using Python/Jupyter Notebook to process data stored in a PostgreSQL data warehouse. The sample distribution of purchase magnitudes was plotted and outlier data was managed for more meaningful sample statistics. Monthly revenue streams and customer activity were also analyzed visually. Finally, formal Recency, Frequency, Magnitude analysis was conducted on the store's clientele,
classifying them into 11 different categories based on their behaviour. Three important categories were identified, and targeted marketing campaigns were suggested for these groups."
  - name: "Hadoop"
    git_url: "/hadoop"
    description: "I am currently engaged in this project, which uses Google Cloud Platform to provision a Hadoop cluster to store a CSV file containing World Development Indicator data in a Hadoop Distributed File System. I am currently running Hive queries on the distributed dataset with the help of both Beeline and Zeppelin user interfaces to extract insights into the state of the world we live in."

    description: "Designed, trained, and tested a regression neural network with Python/TensorFlow/Pandas to forecast the Hourly Ontario Electricity Price; neural network forecasts had a 24% lower mean absolute error relative to the Ontario Independent Electricity Systems Operator's prediction models over an entire year's worth of price data."
  - name: "Reinforcement Learning Resource Allocation for LTE D2D-Enabled Smart Grid"
    git_url:
    description: "Formulated a multi-agent Q-learning resource allocation algorithm aimed at minimizing the packet drop rates of smart grid devices in an out of network coverage scenario. The algorithm and engineering models were coded in Matlab/Simulink, leveraging Simscape Power Systems, SimEvents, and LTE System Toolbox. The algorithm outperformed the LTE standard algorithm, demonstrating 20%-40% absolute reductions in packet drop rate and 10-20 ms reductions in latency for all smart grid applications modeled. The results of this project have been published in two peer-reviewed IEEE journals. IEEE Access DOI: 10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2920662; IEEE Systems Journal DOI: 10.1109/JSYST.2020.3025202"

# Core Java Apps
This project consists of three different applications, and links to their dedicated READMEs
are included below.
1. [Java Grep App](./grep)
	- This application leverages Java streams to lazily load text documents into the JVM's memory one line at a time in search for occurences of a user-defined regular expression pattern in limited heap space conditions.
2. [JDBC App](./jdbc)
	- This application implements a Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern while leveraging JDBC drivers to exchange information between a PostgreSQL database and a Java application.
3. [Twitter CLI App](./twitter)
	- This application offers a professional grade solution to a Java-powered Command Line Interface tool for users to interact with Twitter's REST API. Apache Maven, SpringBoot, and JUnit were utilized for project build cycle management, dependency management, and unit/integration testing design. A MVC design pattern was also followed.

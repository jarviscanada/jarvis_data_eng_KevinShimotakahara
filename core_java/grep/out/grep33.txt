Once upon a time there was a hot dog.
This hot dog swore to exact vengeance on the cat that destroyed its home.
The hot dog landed in the street and got run over.
Once upon a time there was a hot dog.
But all the cat could find was a hot dog stand.
It burned the hot dog stand to the ground and took a nap.
